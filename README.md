## 🌟 Why This Project Matters

Ever wondered why your 3D prints fail? **Warping**, **layer shifting**, **stringing** — these defects cost time, material, and frustration. Our AI-powered system detects these issues in real-time with just a few training examples per defect type!

> 🧠 **The Magic**: Using Prototypical Networks, we teach machines to recognize defects like humans do — from just a handful of examples.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

### 🚀 What We Built
A **lightweight**, **intelligent** classification system that:
- ✨ Identifies 6 major FDM printing defects
- 🧠 Learns from minimal labeled data (few-shot learning)
- ⚡ Provides real-time defect detection
- 🎯 Achieves high accuracy with limited training samples

### 🔥 Key Features
```
🎨 Smart Learning    → Few examples, maximum impact
⚡ Real-time Detection → Instant defect identification  
🎯 High Accuracy     → Reliable classification results
💡 Lightweight      → Runs on standard hardware
```

### 🔄 The Process Simplified

1. **🖼️ Image Input**: Feed support images (known defects) + query image (unknown)
2. **🧠 Feature Extraction**: CNN extracts meaningful patterns from each image
3. **📊 Prototype Creation**: Calculate average embeddings for each defect class
4. **📏 Similarity Matching**: Compare query embedding with all prototypes
5. **🎯 Final Prediction**: Assign the closest matching defect category

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Think of prototypes as "ideal examples" of each defect type that the model remembers!

## 💡 Why Few-Shot Learning?

<div align="center">

### Traditional ML vs Few-Shot Learning

| Traditional Approach | Few-Shot Learning |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 🗃️ Thousands of images per class | 📸 Just 5-10 examples |
| ⏳ Long training times | ⚡ Quick adaptation |
| 💰 Expensive data collection | 💡 Cost-effective |
| 🔒 Fixed to training classes | 🔄 Flexible to new defects |

</div>

> **🎯 Perfect for 3D Printing**: In real manufacturing, we rarely have thousands of defect examples!
